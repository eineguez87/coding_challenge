Code Challenge by Edgardo Ineguez

The prompt for this coding challenge is as follows: 
Create a simple comment system for a website with the following requirements:
* Required fields are name and comment.
* Page must not refresh when adding a comment.
* A max of 3 levels in nested commments.
* Comments must be ordered by post date.

I decided to use a a small PHP framework called Flight. This allowed me to quickly build a RESTful application. 
Other libraries used:
* JQuery
* Bootstrap (for super basic CSS).

Modified code lives in the folders
* controllers
* models
* resources/css/comments.css
* resources/js/comments.js
