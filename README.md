TMBC Code Challenge by Edgardo Ineguez

I decided to use a a small PHP framework called Flight. This allowed me to quickly build a RESTful application. 
Other libraries used:
* JQuery
* Bootstrap (for super basic CSS).

Modified code lives in the folders
* controllers
* models
* resources/css/comments.css
* resources/js/comments.js
